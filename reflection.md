- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My first impression is that association makes it more important to note how I choose to organise my classes. Making the classes individually was easier, but mapping them together with the Train class was more difficult. I tried putting the toString() methods all in the Train class at first, but that didn't work so I put them all in their respective classes.
